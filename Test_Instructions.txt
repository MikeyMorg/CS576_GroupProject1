Currently I tested the server file by running 'python server.py' in the code folder in a Windows Powershell Terminal.
Then, in another terminal I run the following block:
"
$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient
$client.Connect("127.0.0.1", 3490)

$stream = $client.GetStream()
$writer = New-Object System.IO.StreamWriter($stream)
$reader = New-Object System.IO.StreamReader($stream)

$writer.WriteLine("WorldHEllo!~ ~")
$writer.Flush()

$response = $reader.ReadLine()
Write-Host "Server replied: [$response]"

$client.Close()
"

Currently, the server only allows me to store one message at a time, but after it times out and I run a new message, it will accept the new message and reply with the encoded message. I have not yet implemented the functionality to store multiple messages, but I will work on that next.
